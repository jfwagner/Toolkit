-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 4 types of optics - all called from general/madx :

ft_noqs.str:
  1) the CNGS beam at injection (14 GeV/c)
  2) the CNGS beam during the ramp
  3) the CNGS beam at extraction (400 GeV/c)
  4) but it is also used for the fixed target beam at injection
  5) and for the fixed target beam during the ramp

ft_noqs_ext.str:
Could be used soon for slow extraction w/o q-split.
  M. Gyr is calculating the strength of the extraction sextupoles.

ft_qs_ext.str:
SPS Shared slow extraction north (west extraction does not exist any more)
  ft_qs_ext.str is presently used for the fixed target
  slow extraction at top energy (400 GeV/c)

lhc_newwp.str:
  1) at injection (26 GeV/c, not 14)
  2) during the ramp
  3) and at extraction (450 GeV/c)

SPS_Q20.str:

Excecute a madx job in directory madx:
>madx < ft_noqs.madx

or, for special tasks:
>madx < general.madx

Two MADX jobs added for the beam dump system in LSS1 in the SPS.
The reason is that the quadrupoles 11710/11810/11910
are displaced deliberately to form a closed orbit bump both in x and y.
The two MADX jobs are made by Alex Koschik and Thomas Kramer:
 /cmd/lss1_q171819_displacement.madx
 /cmd/lss1_q171819_rematchbumpclosure.madx

The alignments are also extracted and placed in:
 /alignments/lss1_q171819_displacement.align                                  O.B.       20/2/2007

The file: /cmd/lss1_q171819_rematchbumpclosure.madx was removed.
Possibly a different strategy should be found, than to correct
the orbit by tuning the quadrupoles                                           G.A. O.B.  22/2/2007

Corrected SPS skew quadrupoles. Changed K1 to K1S for LQSA in /strength/elements.str.
Thanks to Ilya Agapov for finding this.                                       O.B.      10/10/2007

Modifications during the 2007-2008 shutdown implemented                       O.B.       28/4/2008

New sequence and element files in the 2008-2009 shutdown.
New aperture files being prepared by S.Chemli.                                O.B.        6/5/2009

New sequence and element files for 2010.
From layoutdatabase P.Leroux/S.Chemli/R.Billen.                               O.B.       27/9/2010

SPS_Q20.str introduced by Y.Papaphilippou and H.Bartosik                      O.B.       10/3/2011

New sequence and element files for 2011 from layoutdatabase.
SPS collimator was missing. Thanks to Francesca Galluccio for finding this.   O.B.       29/6/2011

New SPS files                                                                 O.B.       23/6/2014
